# what-happened-to-jbusterj
what happened to all my repositories?  
long story short, my github account was filled with projects i used to learn functionality of javascript / python libraries  
this made it hard for me to manage my own projects  
as a result of this, i made a new account and all my personal projects have been moved there  
all repositories that were previously on this account are now privated. this will be the case until i find a need to bring them back  
it was nice having this account, but my 10-11 year old self wasnt the best at managing code in repositories  
goodbye, JBusterJ
